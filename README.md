🌱 Web Development Daily Challenge: Day 4–6
⚠️ Day 4 - Break in Progress
I didn't make any progress today. Got distracted and fell into procrastination. Rather than pretending otherwise, I'm noting it honestly — this challenge is for growth, not perfection.

⚠️ Day 5 - Still Stuck
Another day lost to procrastination and unproductive habits. But I’m being truthful here because hiding it doesn’t help — learning comes from reflection, not denial. I'm using this realization to build consistency again.

✅ Day 6 - Comeback with Tables
Today, I got back to work — and it felt great.
What I Learned:
How to create tables using HTML
Tags: <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <td>, <th>
Properties: rowspan, colspan
Structuring data clearly in a layout

Problem Solved:
Built a sample problem involving a real-world table — applying the concepts of merged cells and headers.

Reflection:
Missing two days made me feel off-track, but facing it honestly helped me return stronger. This challenge isn’t just about code — it’s about building discipline and resilience too.

✅ Back on track. Moving ahead with Day 7!
